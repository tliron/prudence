Prudence: JavaScript
====================

Eventually we hope to have detailed API documentation.

For now, here's the documentation of the APIs as they appear in Go:

* [`prudence`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tliron/prudence/js#PrudenceAPI)
* [`context`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tliron/prudence/rest#Context)
